description: Get tscad up and running locally
---

tscad is all about developer experience. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to create and work with parametric CAD models. So there is a command line interface to create new tscad projects:

```shell tab="pnpm (recommended)"
pnpm create @tscad
```

```shell tab="npm"
npm init @tscad
```

```shell tab="yarn"
yarn create @tscad
```

Running the `@tscad/create` package will create all files necessary for a new tscad project.

It will also start the [dev command](/docs/dev).

<Callout title="Previewing your model locally">

If you did not install the [vscode extension](/docs/guides/ide-integration), open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

</Callout>

Now, **open `./src/model.ts`** in your favorite code editor and start editing the model. The dev server will automatically reload the preview whenever you save the file.
