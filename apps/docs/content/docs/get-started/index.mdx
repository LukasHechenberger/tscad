tscad is all about developer experience. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to create and work with parametric CAD models. So there is a command line interface to create new tscad projects:

```shell tab="pnpm (recommended)"
pnpm create @tscad
```

```shell tab="npm"
npm init @tscad
```

```shell tab="yarn"
yarn create @tscad
```

Running the `@tscad/create` package will create all files necessary for a new tscad project.

It will also start the [dev command](/docs/dev).
