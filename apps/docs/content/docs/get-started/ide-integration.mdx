For the ideal development experience, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) together with our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tscad.tscad-vscode).

Once the extension is installed you can run `tscad dev` and a preview of your model will be shown in the editor.
