## Introduction

tscad is a CAD modeller for programmers. It is designed to provide a modern developer experience with a focus on TypeScript and JavaScript, allowing users to create parametric CAD models using familiar programming languages and modern tools.

## tscad models

A model usually consists of a single TypeScript or JavaScript module, which exports a model:

{/* <div className="sticky top-16"> */}

```ts title="A simple tscad model"
import { defineModel } from '@tscad/modeling';

export default defineModel({
  // model definition goes here
});
```

{/* </div> */}

### The model function

Each model needs a `model` function that returns the CAD geometry. You can use the built-in primitives and operations from tscad to create your model.

```ts title="A simple tscad model"
import { defineModel } from '@tscad/modeling';
import { cube } from '@tscad/modeling/primitives';

/** A simple model that renders as a cube */
export default defineModel({
  model: () => cube({ size: 10 }), // [!code highlight]
});
```

### Previewing models

The simplest way to preview your model is to use the [online playground](/playground). Just copy-paste your code into the editor and see the result immediately.

{/* <div className="sticky top-16"> */}

<Callout>TODO: Add playground screenshot</Callout>

{/* </div> */}

### Define model parameters

You can define parameters for your model using the `defineModel` function. This allows you to create parametric models that can be easily adjusted.

```ts title="A parametric tscad model"
export default defineModel({
  parameters: { // [!code highlight:3]
    width: { type: 'number', default: 10, min: 1, max: 100, step: 1 },
  },
  model: ...
});
```

### Use model parameters

As soon as parameters are defined, you can use them in your model function:

```ts title="A parametric tscad model"
export default defineModel({
  parameters: {
    width: { type: 'number', default: 10, min: 1, max: 100, step: 1 },
  },
  model: ({ width }) => cube({ size: width }), // [!code highlight]
});
```
