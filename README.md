jscad, but for modern developers

<!-- #endregion header -->

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress.

## Inspiration

I wanna have an open source parametric CAD solution with good developer tooling. I draw my interest from seeing other open source projects doing great work on the CAD front, but lack the dx[^dx] a modern developer expects:

### OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD is great because it has a ton of features and a pretty active community to help resolve issues.

Sadly, they invented their own programming language and their own IDE, which lack many basic features like autocompletion and cannot compete with modern AI-assisted IDEs. You can use your own IDE (e.g. VS Code with some plugins) and use the OpenSCAD app just for rendering, but still, own programming language and documentation is sparse. Also, the performance can be really bad for some models.

### JSCAD

Similar to OpenSCAD, but they use JavaScript for coding.

They lack the same essentials to DX: Their own IDE (a website, actually) has a very basic code editor, with no autocompletion as well. The model preview is fine actually, but the documentation is not really up-to-date and very basic. The API is stable, so we'll (re)use many of their APIs.

> I just wanna add once more, these projects are my main inspiration and I totally admire these guys for their work. You layed the groundwork for this project.

## Goals

In order to achieve a better developer experience, I wanna focus on these primary goals to increase the allover developer experience with parametric CAD:

## Modern programming

I wanna use **TypeScript** in this project. It's a solid programming language with excellent tooling. You can also run it in a browser and use it on basically any OS, which is great to integrate other tools/services.

As Typescript is basically JavaScript with types I wanna also support JavaScript and the entire npm universe to make things modular.

## Flexible tooling

First and foremost I wanna provide a stable, strongly typed TypeScript API for parametric CAD with a good documentations. It should basically have the same functionality as JSCAD, just in TypeScript.

> At this point, users can create CAD models and e.g. export them to STL.

Next, I wanna create a flexible preview based on web technology. This way we can easily run it in a browser, on a server and in a desktop app (with something like Tauri).

We can then use this preview to create a command line application to build and preview our models. It basically runs a webserver that updates the page when the underlying code changes.

> Now users are able to preview their models as they code. You can even use an in-IDE-browser (like VSCode's Simple Browser) to preview code and preview side by side.

Now we can also use the preview and put it in an online web application together with an online IDE.

> Now we're talking: We're basically feature-complete with OpenSCAD and JSCAD.

## Good documentation

Alongside the online IDE I wanna host an extensive documentation with a good search.
